# Personal medical cost
><img src="https://github.com/m0gr1m/Personal_medical_cost/blob/main/cost.png?raw=true"  width="200" align="left"> Health problems and the high cost of medical services make it an extremely important part of our lives to have health insurance. Not only does it help to cover the cost of any treatment or surgery, but it also gives you the peace of mind that - in the case of an accident - you won't end up with a huge bill that you'll be paying for for the next decade.
